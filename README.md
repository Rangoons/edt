## For EagleDream Technologies technical demonstration
## Technologies used: React & ES6

### To run
1. Install node if it is not already installed
2. navigate to the root of the directory
3. run `npm install`
4. once finished, run `npm start`
5. your browser should automatically open and be pointed to localhost:3000

### What I was not able to accomplish
1. Some of React's best practices (I started learning it the day after I received the project prompt)
2. Proper error handling
3. Hiding the compare stats section on a new search
4. Sometimes on the initial launch after `npm start`, a search will execute but the data does not populate, this bug does not persist through page refreshes.
